FOR DEVELOPERS:
all header files in **/headers/ should include all neccesary things,
you should NOT include them. In all .c files(except screened.c), 
ONLY INCLUDE THE HEADER. This also applies when creating new C 
files. All standard libraries should be included in include.h,
not from the header files or source files; example:

Double-inclusion also messes everything up real bad; so please,
in sample.h, have a #define INCLUDE_SAMPLE line, and in sample.c
have
------------------------------
#ifndef INCLUDE_SAMPLE
#include "headers/sample.h"
#endif
-----------------------------
to prevent double-inclusion.

------newfeatures/testfeature.c------
#ifndef INCLUDE_TESTFEATURE
#include "headers/testfeature.h"
#endif

int testfeature()
{
...
...
}

-------------------------------------
^This file should not contain any other #include lines!

------newfeatures/headers/testfeature.h------
#include "...whatever header files needed by newfeatures/testfeature.c"
#include "../../include.h"
#define INCLUDE_TESTFEATURE
int testfeature();
---------------------------------------------

Also, please follow the laws of UNIX programming and K&R style.
Thanks for helping out!

FOR USERS:
if you are seeing this, you are not a user. If you are, good luck
getting it working... it's not working yet. Either wait patiently
or make it into a useable text editor(and if you manage that, again,
you're no user; please refer to the 'FOR DEVELOPERS' section)
